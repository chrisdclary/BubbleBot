This is a Discord bot I made for fun for my private servers.

The command character is '.'
All it can do right now is play rock, paper, scissors using '.rps'

There are a commands, mostly for debugging:
.debug 		- toggles debug mode
.leave		- forces bot to leave the voice channel
.cmdPop		- removes a command from the command queue
.cmdClear	- clears the command queue
.viewQueue	- prints the command queue to the console
.play		- opens a play menu, not fully implemented
.rps 		- plays rock paper scissors

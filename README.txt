This is a Discord bot I made for fun for my private servers.

You can use this code if you want, just be sure to credit me 
somehow unless you make large alterations, and you will just 
have to write your own auth.json with your Discord OAuth token. 
Also you'd probably want to remove or repurpose the ktrue stuff, 
it's just an inside joke.

The command character is '.'
All it can do right now is play rock, paper, scissors using '.rps'

There are a commands, mostly for debugging:
.debug 		    - toggles debug mode
.leave		    - forces bot to leave the voice channel
.cmdPop		    - removes a command from the command queue
.cmdClear	    - clears the command queue
.viewQueue 	    - prints the command queue to the console
.play		    - opens a play menu, not fully implemented
.rps 		    - plays rock paper scissors
.wr             - displays your rps winrate
.money          - check your money/debt
.borrow         - borrow money
.repay          - repay debt
